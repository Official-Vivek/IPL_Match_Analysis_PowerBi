✨Greetings,  community!✨

Learning is the Key of success, So Don't stop your learning.

I'm again thrilled to share with you all my recent project on 𝐈𝐏𝐋 𝐌𝐀𝐓𝐂𝐇 𝐀𝐍𝐀𝐋𝐘𝐒𝐈𝐒 𝐮𝐬𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐏𝐨𝐰𝐞𝐫 𝐁𝐈! 

🌟 Embracing the Power of analysis in hashtag#PowerBI! 💡📊

This data set contain record from 2008 to 2022 of IPL Matches
So I tried to derived some helpful insights from this #dashboard to analyze the match season by performing #ETL, #Joins(#Merge & #Append), 
#CustomQuery & #DAX .

💡Insights :
✅ Season wise Trophy Holder
✅ Season wise hashtag#PurpleCap Holder
✅ Season wise hashtag#OrangeCap Holder
✅ Total No of Sixes & Fours in season

👉 I applied filter to the report to analyze the data on season wise.

💡 Filters is main tool of any report that helps to analyze the report quickly. 

✅ Provided Season( Match Year) filter for yearly analysis.
✅ Provided Filter on Batsman & Bowler to analyze the player wise performance.

💡 Crafted a hashtag#chart to analyze the following :

✅ Match Wins by Result(#Wicket / #Runs)
✅Match wins on #Toss decision 
✅ Match wins By #Venue
✅ Total match wins By season.
